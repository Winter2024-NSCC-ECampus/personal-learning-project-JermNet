# MILESTONE 1
## HOW TO RUN
1. Download these files onto your PC
2. Install Python 3 if you haven't already (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Open a terminal in the directory these files are in
4. Run the command "py main.py" and you're good to go!

## THOUGHT PROCESS
This is a project done for my self study course, in which I decided to learn Python. We have to do 4 milestones, so I've decided that my first milestone would mostly be learning the language. Still, I felt as through I needed something to prove that's what I was doing, so I decided to remake one of my finals in the Python language. It's mostly the same, but one of my favourite changes is that I now save and load data as JSON, which is much more handy than what I had before.

## THOUGHT PROCESS
This is a project done for my self study course, in which I decided to learn Python. We have to do 4 milestones, and originally I was going to start on the graphical stuff with milestone 3, but there's so much and I'm so interested in it that I decided to fast track this to milestone 2! My original milestone 4 is now the new milestone 3, and now I have an even bigger, better milestone 4 that I've been working on and am really proud of so far. So, for this one, I've decided to make snake (with my own touches, of course) using one of many Python graphical libraries, turtle. I'll be using other graphical libraries for my other milestones, as I really want to expand my skills and checking out a bunch of different libraries is a fun way to do that.

## THOUGHT PROCESS
This is a project done for my self study course, in which I decided to learn Python! We have to do 4 milestones, and this is the third! The last one was graphical, and the next will be too, but both are largely different from this. One of my main goals is to use different Python modules, and I've used three different graphical libraries for my three different graphical programs!
