# THOUGHT PROCESS
This is a project done for my self study course, in which I decided to learn Python. We have to do 4 milestones, so I've decided that my first milestone would mostly be learning the language. Still, I felt as through I needed something to prove that's what I was doing, so I decided to remake one of my finals in the Python language. It's mostly the same, but one of my favourite changes is that I now save and load data as JSON, which is much more handy than what I had before.
