# HOW TO RUN
1. Download these files onto your PC
2. Install Python 3 if you haven't already (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Open a terminal in the directory these files are in
4. Run the command "py selector.py" and you're good to go!

# THOUGHT PROCESS
This is a project done for my self study course, in which I decided to learn Python! We have to do 4 milestones, and this is the last one! This requires a little bit of history, but to try and keep it brief, in the late 00's, there was a program called "VNDS" which let users play visual novels (story based video games) on the Nintendo DS. These visual novels were created in a very simple language and then interpreted. What I have here is a PC interpreter for VNDS made completely from scratch. Aside from save files, it's complete compatible both ways, and makes testing VNDS format novels really easy. There are still some features I want to add to this, and I want to make it look nicer, too, but as it currently is, it is pretty highly featured.
